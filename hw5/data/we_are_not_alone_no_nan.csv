325,USA,38,Female,3,3,1,5,3,Peaceful & Inspired,"The gift of time has afforded me the opportunity to ground, slow down, reevaluate what's important in my life. With the quietude, yoga, gratitude,self study, and mediataion, Im able to see and feel more clearly as I was going in so many different directions prior to the required isolation brought on by the pandemic. I was burning out.The time to myself has afforded me the opportunity to read, paint, write, reflect and still connect with others. I'm sad about people suffering. That noted, suffering is part of the human condition.  My illusion of control is where I fall into the fear trap & anxiety rears it's head. But when I sit in stillness I realize that the Universe/Divine/God is in charge and surrounding circumstance are out of my control, even if i don'tfully understand. My faith in this or something better sustains me.I can only control what I can control and if I get sick and die, then, as much as I'm not ready to leave, there is little I can do as it's my expiration date. At the end of the day, appreciation for what is good and savoring those moments keeps me peaceful, fulfilled and inspired. Lastly, seeing so many people come together gives me great joy and hope for humanity. ","The gift of time.
